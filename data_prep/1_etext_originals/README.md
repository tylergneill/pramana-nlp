# Note on Sharing of Source Data

Ideally, I would prefer to use for my Sanskrit NLP work only data that is publically available online, so as to promote transparency and reproducibility. For this reason, my default data source is GRETIL, seen here as .htm files. (Muktabodha would also have worked, but it does not encourage comprehensive downloading and also tends to have less pramāṇa material anyway.)

Secondarily, I also use the pramāṇa texts found on SARIT, which tend to require a considerable amount of additional preprocessing, due to their having been encoded in XML. These are the only .xml source files.

My own cleaned versions of both the GRETIL and SARIT files, in simplified .txt, are are also posted. In the case of SARIT, these simplified files represent a genuine improvement on usability for those who like to be able to search through many files at once on their own computers.

On the other hand, for some texts, the best or only available versions exist only in private collections not shared publically online. In cases where I have come into possession of such files and chosen to use them here, I have also made an effort to obtain permission from the creators to post the originals and/or my modifications thereof. Obviously, it is not equally possible to share such work in every such situation.

The following files are posted publically here for the first time, either with explicit permission of their authors, or after having made good faith efforts to get in touch. Corresponding metadata files can be consulted for more details, especially in cases where I could not post the source files, which often contain additional information.

* Kumārilabhaṭṭa's Ślokavārttika
* Bhāsarvajña's Nyāyabhūṣaṇa

also working on...

* Udayana's Ātmatattvaviveka
* Maṇḍanamiśra's Bhāvanāviveka
* Vidyākaraśānti's Tarkasopāna
* Śaṅkarasvāmin's Nyāyapraveśakasūtra
* Haribhadrasūri's Nyāyapraveśavṛtti
* Śrīdhara's Nyāyakandalī

Similarly, the following are being posted as e-texts for the first time, having been newly digitzed from PDFs for this project.

* Jayarāśi's Tattvopaplavasiṃha, chs. 7–14 (Sanghavi & Parikh edition)
* Vyomaśiva's Vyomavatī (Gaurinath Shastri 1984 edition)
* Jayanta's Nyāyakalikā, through nirṇaya (Kataoka edition "part 1")

The following files, either obtained from others or created from scratch, were judged to not yet be suitable for sharing.

* Dharmakīrti's Hetubindu (STTAR edition)
* Dharmakīrti's Pramāṇaviniścaya (STTAR edition, 2 vols.)
* Jinendrabuddhi's Pramāṇasamuccayaṭīkā (STTAR edition, chs. 1 and 2 in 2 vols.)

* Uddyotakara's Nyāyavārttika (K. Preisendanz's combination of Calcutta and Thakur editions)
* Vāgīśvarabhaṭṭa's Nyāyatātparyadīpikā (K. Preisendanz?)
* Pravāduka's Nyāyasūtravivaraṇa (O. Frey, and K. Preisendanz?)

Finally, the following privately-sourced were included in the first round of this project and are excluded from the second round. Most are so fragmentary as to be unhelpful for the current purposes.

* Dharmottara's Nyāyabinduṭīkā
* Abhayadevasūri's Tattvabodhavidhāyinī
* Pārthasārathi's Nyāyaratnākara
* Prabhācandra's Nyāyakumudacandra
* Prabhācandra's Prameyakamalamārtaṇda
* Vādidevasūri's Syādvādaratnākara
