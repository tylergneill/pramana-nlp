Structural Summary

In this file of Jñānaśrimitra's Nibandhāvali are contained the twelve smaller texts, each with its own <div>, numbered 1–12. However, some of these <div> elements have no content of their own but instead defer to further nested <div> elements, namely: 1.1–1.4, 7.1–7.3, 11.1–11.6, 12.1–12.4. In one case, the nesting goes yet another level down: 7.4.1–7.4.3. This poses no major obstacle, however, to generating document candidates; material is simply iteratively bubbled up from lower levels to higher levels, extracting structural information along the way, until ultimately it can be processed all together.

Basically, then, the desired natural-language text is reconstituted from highest-level <p> and <lg> elements, and document identifiers are created for each of these from the text number, subsection number (where applicable), and number of paragraph (or verse). The topic <div> elements for the twelve texts are used as natural boundaries for document grouping, as are numbers for subsections where they exist.


Other Notable Encoding Issues

1) Inconsistencies found with <lb break="no"/>.

2) Some in-line notes encoded only with the formatting element <span>, which otherwise used for material to be accepted as part of the text, rather than with <note> tags, e.g. ... <span rend="k2">प्र० वा० ३. १९०</span>. (The difference between "k1" and "k2" remains somewhat mysterious.) Similarly, material that is surely a footnote "स्वोपज्ञवृत्त्यनुसारी पाठः" ends up in-line. This material must therefore be carefully distinguished after the transform as not part of the natural-language flow of the text itself. Extensive revision of the source xml would be required.

3) The <div> element for subsection 7.4.3 "तृतीयः खण्डः" lacked an @n attribute, which was fixed for the "modified" file ultimately transformed.
