Edition: A.B. Dhruva 1930, GOS 38, Nyāyapraveśa with three commentaries


Extent: complete


Input by: not yet determined 


Structural Notes: 

The text consists of Candrasūri's (here, erroneously! Haribhadrasūri's) prose commentary on Śaṅkarasvāmin's (elsewhere, such as with Jambūvijaya-ji: Dignāga's) short Nyāyapraveśa. (This disagreement on authorship should be addressed in a future round.) The latter base text, not numbered in this edition, is included here as an integral part of the commentary text.

Document candidates were created somewhat artificially, in most cases corresponding to a double-daṇḍa (//). Identifiers were created for each of these with the page and line numbers provided.

For document grouping, the numbering (1–27) of the base text in Muni Jambūvijaya-ji's 2009 edition was manually placed here. This labor-intensive process led to a few new document candidates as seemed necessary. An alternative, perhaps more consistent approach — realized only after reaching a better understanding of the relationship between these two texts — would have been to make use of the detailed structural analysis found in the Śaṅkarasvāmin Nyāyapraveśakasūtra file (q.v.). This could be done in a second round.
