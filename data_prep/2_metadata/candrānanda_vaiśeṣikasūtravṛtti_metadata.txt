Extent: complete


Input by: M. Tokunaga and others (?)


Structural Notes:

Prose commentary on aphoristic Vaiśeṣika Sūtra. Consists of 10 adhyāyas, the first 7 of which have 2 āhnikas each (the final sūtra numbers of which are: 1.1.29, 1.2.18, 2.1.28, 2.2.43, 3.1.14, 3.2.17, 4.1.14, 4.2.9, 5.1.18, 5.2.28, 6.1.18, 6.2.19, 7.1.32, 7.2.31, 8.17, 9.28, 10.21).

Document candidates were generated from indented prose paragraphs and verse material (the latter when not preceded by an em-dash or similar direct lead-in). Document grouping based on numbered sūtra-commentary sections.


Other Important Notes:

1) A very few paragraph breaks were added to better affiliate introductory material with sūtras.
