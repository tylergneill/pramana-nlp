Structural Notes: 

This text consists of an independent prose treatise in two parts: 1) a characterization of nigrahasthāna, and 2) an enumeration of types.

Document candidates were produced from paragraphs, which were restored in re-digitization. Identifiers are of the type page_number,line_number, the markup for which was manually extended as needed.

Document grouping was performed according to sections in Much's analysis, prioritizing those that appear as page headers in Much's edition and translation. For part 1 of the work, this was rather difficult. Much's analysis and page headers were found to sometimes be at odds, seemingly reflecting overlapping structural descriptions. The compromise reached was to mark the following sections: 0, 1, b, c, c212, c22, c222, 112, 121, 122. By contrast, part 2 was much simpler, with its clearly distinguished sections for nigrahasthāna types. The following table shows the grouping labels used and serves as a reduced form of Much's analysis:

Other Important Notes: 

1) Starting with the Ono GRETIL text, sandhi was restored (including coalescent sandhi in almost all cases).

2) Numerous typos were also silently corrected in the e-text to restore Much readings, and occasionally changes were also made to correct clear mistakes in the edition.
