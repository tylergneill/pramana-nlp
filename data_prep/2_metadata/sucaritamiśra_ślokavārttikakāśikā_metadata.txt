Edition: Trivandrum 1926, 1929, 1943 (Trivandrum Sanskrit Series, 90, 99, 150), K. Sāmbaśiva Śāstrī


Extent: complete digitization of published Trivandrum editions covering from pratijñāsūtra (§1) to sambandhākṣepavāda (§5.11); later sections of work (sphoṭavāda §5.12 to vedapauruṣeyatādhikaraṇa §8) not covered by the discontinued project are therefore not found here


Input by: Helmut Krasser, Wien


Structural Notes: 

This text consists of Sucaritamiśra's prose Kāśikā on Kumārilabhaṭṭa's verse Ślokavārttika; Sucaritamiśra refers to the Ślokavārttika with pratīkas, and so the full Ślokavārttika is not included as part of the text here. Both texts share the same conventional structure: eight top-level sections, with eighteen subsections for the fifth section (autpattikasūtra); cp. metadata for the Ślokavārtika.

Document candidates were generated from paragraph markings found in the source file, with identifiers of the type page_number,pargraph_number (the latter in roman numerals). Document grouping was carried out according to fourteen section header labels found marked in the source file (subject to correction, see note below).


Other Important Notes: 

1) Numbering of vārttika-and-kāśikā sections was found to be rather inconsistent and in need of extensive correction. Detailed notes elsewhere record all changes made.

2) The incompleteness of the Trivandrum project (see Extent above) seems to have been misunderstood or obscured during initial digitization. Namely, the section following "010 citrākṣepavāda" in the original file was incorrectly labeled as "018 ātmavāda". This seems to reflect either an eyeskip when reading the table of contents — on the basis of the visually similar subsection title "017 citrākṣepaparihāra" — or wishful thinking that the publication contained at least the full text of the autpattikasūtra section, or both. Section labels have been corrected here.

3) Difficulty was experienced in interpreting editorial mark-up, especially the use of parentheses for a variety of outcomes with unpredictable spacing. For example: "nābhāvaśa(ṅkā)" for, post-correction, "nābhāvaśaṅkā"; "tad etan (tam ekaṃ)" for "tam ekaṃ"; "īdṛśa(?me/e)kaḥ" for "īdṛśa ekaḥ"; and "siddhāntasthiti(?ḥ/r) sati" for "siddhāntasthitir asati". This was silently simplified in the first round of digitization, and it was judged impractical to re-do this with more the more sensitive markup of the second round, e.g. (...)〈...〉.

4) In-line footnote markers were most often to be replaced with space when removed, e.g., "upajananāt.[730]santi khalu". However, this could not be consistently done. Examples of markers with more unpredictable spacing: "pṛthakkṛ[14]tasya" (definitely no space needed); "sā cāptasyāvijñāte[482]na sambhavatīti" (i.e., possible case confusion); "tad[296]apagame śuklam" (i.e., possible compound confusion).
