Structural Notes: 

Commentary on Nyāyasūtra, reflects same structure (1.1.1 – 5.2.24).

Document candidates generated from sutra-and-commentary sections, with straightfoward identifiers based on adhyāya.āhnika.sūtra numbering.

Document grouping based on prakaraṇa headers.	


Other Important Notes: 

1) Significant clean-up of numbers and sūtra marking required. Some bhāṣya sections extended to include material up until clear structural markers.

2) [...] corrections silently accepted.
