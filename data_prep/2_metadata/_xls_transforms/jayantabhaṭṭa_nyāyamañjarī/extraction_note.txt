Structural Summary

In this file, the desired natural-language text, Jayantabhaṭṭa's Nyāyamañjarī (NM), is found by selectively extracting the NM <quote> elements from the surrounding Nyāyasaurabhaṭippaṇī (NSṬ) commentary that makes up the <body> element. This encoding reflects that the NSṬ was printed below the NM on the pages of Varadacharya's 1969-1983 Mysore edition; the NSṬ does not quote the NM in full. The NSṬ only extends for the first 3 out of 12 āhnikas. Nevertheless, for āhnikas 4–12, the same <quote> within <div> structure holds. Thus, the basic NM text is reconstituted by reconstructing the two-level <div> structure within the main <body> element with basically only the NM <quote> elements inside (plus <pb> etc.)

The two-level <div> structure is: 1) physical volume, 2) logical āhnika. Vol. I contains āhnikas 1–4, vol. II contains āhnikas 5–12.

From out of this structure, paragraphs were retained as the primary document candidate, with identifiers of the type page_number,paragraph_number (the latter in roman numerals). Grouping was performed on the basis of verbose section headers.


Other Notable Encoding Issues

1) Inconsistencies such as with <lb break="no"/> necessitated extensive prooreading of page and paragraph breaks.
