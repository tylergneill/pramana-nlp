Structural Summary

Malvania's 1971 edition printed the NBṬ and NB at the top of the page and DUP at the bottom, but judging from the latter's pratīka-style of citation, Durvekamiśra himself did not actually quote his base-texts in full. Thus, two separate works were extracted from this file: Dharmottara's Nyāyabinduṭīkā (NBṬ) and Durvekamiśra's subcommentary Dharmottarapradīpa (DUP).

Since the <body> element encodes the latter with the former in <quote> elements, the former was obtained by extracting basically only the <quote> elements from within the <body> element (plus <pb> etc.), while the latter was extracted by doing the opposite, i.e., extracting everything but the <quote> elements.

Document candidates were created on the basis of prose paragraphs for both texts, with identifiers of the type page_number,paragraph_number (the latter in roman numerals). Document grouping was performed on the basis of chapter.sūtra structure.


Other Notable Encoding Issues

1) Inconsistencies such as with placement of <pb>, placement of base-text NB <quote> elements, and <lb break="no"/> (including issues with hyphen) necessitated proofreading of page and paragraph breaks.

2) For extraction of the NBṬ, placement of NB <quote> elements was found to prioritize the physical layout of the printed edition over the logical structure of Durvekamiśra's prose. Thus it was necessary to manually proofread (e.g., on the basis of double-daṇḍas) association of such material with NBṬ commentary.

3) Mark-up found to be lacking for some commentary material, e.g., nb.1.11 (p.67) <quote type="commentary1" ana="nbṭ"> ends too early, leaving "bhūtaḥ sadbhūto'rthaḥ । pramāṇena dṛṣṭaśca sadbhūtaḥ । yathā catvāryāryasatyāni ... tāvat tasyagamanam ।" encoded as DUP altho in fact this still NBṬ. This one case corrected in "modified" file used for transform.
