Structural Summary

In this file of Patañjali's Yogaśāstra, both the Yogaśūtras and the Bhāṣya (encoded here with <quote> elements) are treated as one continuous text by the same author.

The desired natural-language text is found at the bottom of a two-tier <div> structure. The first-tier <div> encodes the 4 chapters (pādas), as well as an introduction (maṅgala). The second-tier <div> encodes a logical section of sūtra with bhāṣya, the numbering of which can be obtained from the @xml:id attribute of the respective child <quote type="base-text"> element (or equivalently, from the text of the corresponding child <label> element following each sūtra).

Document candidates were generated from <p> and <quote> elements, treated as paragraphs. Identifiers are of the type page_number,paragraph_number. Document grouping is based on <div> elements for sūtra sections.


Other Notable Encoding Issues

1) It was necessary to add <pb> elements to the XML file.

2) Introductory (avataraṇa) material for a given sūtra section has been placed within the preceding <div> rather that within the one which follows and with which it shares a closer logical (and most likely semantic) connection, e.g., "<p>tasya lakṣaṇābhidhitsayedaṃ sūtraṃ pravavṛte ---</p>" in 1.1 rather than in 1.2. (Cp., e.g., Vātsyāyana's Nyāyabhāṣya.) This could potentially be changed in the original file if necessary.
