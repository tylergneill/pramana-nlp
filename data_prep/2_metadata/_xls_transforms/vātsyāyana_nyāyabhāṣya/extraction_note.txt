Structural Summary

In this file of Vātsyāyana's Nyāyabhāṣya (NBh) on Gautama's Nyāyasūtras (NS), all NS text quoted in full is considered to be an integral part of the NBh.

The desired natural-language text is found at the bottom of a simple three-tiered <div> structure, reflecting adhyāya, āhnika, and sūtra levels of analysis.

Document candidates were generated from <p> and <quote> elements. Page numbers, given by the @n attribute of <pb> elements, were also extracted. Document identifiers of the type page_number,paragraph_number (the latter in lowercase Roman numerals) were then generated automatically. The topical prakaraṇa level of analysis was not used.


Other Notable Encoding Issues

1) Numerous instances of English-language editorial mark-up was found left in plain-text, unencoded, e.g., "(corr. ...)", "(emend. ...)", "(following ṭhakur ...)".

2) A few document grouping labels were modified to more consistently reflect treatment of several sūtras together in one <div>, e.g., 3.1.28–30.
