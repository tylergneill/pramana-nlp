Structural Summary

In this file of Vātsyāyana's Nyāyabhāṣya (NBh) on Gautama's Nyāyasūtras (NS), all NS text quoted in full is considered to be an integral part of the NBh.

The desired natural-language text is found at the bottom of a simple three-tiered <div> structure, reflecting adhyāya, āhnika, and sūtra levels of analysis.

Document candidates were generated from <p> and secondarily from <quote> elements, with identifiers based on the parent <div> element's @xml:id attribute, plus the element's sequential occurrence within the <div>.

For the purpose of document grouping the topical prakaraṇa level of analysis might have been ideal, but it was not encoded. Instead, the numbered third-tier <div> were used.


Other Notable Encoding Issues

1) Numerous instances of English-language editorial mark-up found left unencoded, e.g., "(corr. ...", "(emend. ...", "(following ṭhakur ...').

2) Groupings of sūtras into a single <div> done inconsistently, e.g., not only was the group 3.1.28_30 not given its own single <div>, despite the commentary ending with the notation "//28-29-30//", it was simply run together with the preceding <div> numbered 3.1.27; meanwhile, 3.1.62 and 3.1.63 were each given their own <div> — with introductory (avataraṇa) material being assigned to the former and the bhāṣya proper to the latter — despite the commentary ending with the notation //62-63//.
