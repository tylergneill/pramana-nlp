rules
	whitespace between elements does not count (gets deleted)
	document structural elements are marked with [...] (if identifying material available) or with [] (if none available, such as for prose paragraphs where pagination info is missing)
	ideally, document structural elements should be designed during cleaning to be approximately within an order of magnitude of the desired size (i.e., between ten times too small and ten times too large)
	section structural elements are marked with {...}
	deletable content notes are encoded with (...)
	deletable structural notes are encoded with <...>
	deletable notes must be designed to remove cleanly, i.e., not interfere with spacing of actual content
	each file must start with a {...}
	each {...} must be followed by a [...] / []
	each [...] / [] must be followed by content
	{...} cannot be empty (nor should deletable notes be: e.g. at least "( )")
