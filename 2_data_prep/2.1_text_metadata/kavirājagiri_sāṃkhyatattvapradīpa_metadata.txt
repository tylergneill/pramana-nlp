Structural Notes: 

Document candidates were generated from paragraphs, which were in turn numbered automatically; in a second round, it would be beneficial to re-do identifiers with page and line numbers, not yet provided in the source file. No document grouping was performed.


Other Important Notes: 

1) A few seeming cases of using extra spaces for emphasis were standardized here, e.g., "na tu ta syāḥ kāra ṇānta ra ṃ kiñcit pra māṇa siddha ṃ ta thātve vā..."
