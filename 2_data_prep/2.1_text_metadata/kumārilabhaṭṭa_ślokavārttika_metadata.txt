Structural Notes: 

The following overview is supplied in Krasser's source file, to which I have added only an artifical numbering of sections and subsections. (I was not sure whether the Vṛttikāragrantha consists of two parts or not.)

Document candidates were generated for each half-line, with identifiers based on the numbering explained above, plus the verse number within the section, plus "ab", "cd", or "ef" based on the pāda.

Document grouping was based on labeled sections and subsections. Since document candidates were very small in this case, the recombination into larger documents based on these grouping boundaries was relatively important.
