Structural Summary

In this file of Ratnakīrti's Nibandhāvali are contained the ten smaller texts, each with its own <div>, which implicitly can be numbered 1–10 based on their order of presentation. Extra internal structure is exceptionally given for work #2 (Īśvarasādhanadūṣaṇam), but this is ignored here, as the division into paragraphs equally found for the other texts is already sufficient.

Although three different sources are said to have been used for the ten respective texts (Thakur 1975 for "1), 2), 3), 4), 6), 7), 9) and 10)"; Mcdermott 1967 for "5)"; and Mimaki 1976 for "8)" — and also again for "4)" and "5)") all are primarily referred to by Thakur 1975 page and line numbers throughout in the @xml:id attribute of <p> elements.

Document candidates were therefore generated from <p> and <lg> elements — the latter subsequently being associated backward with the former, as were <p> elements lacking page and line info — with identifiers based on the physical features of the Thakur edition as mentioned above.

For document grouping, <head> elements associated with each text's <div> provided ideal logical boundaries.
