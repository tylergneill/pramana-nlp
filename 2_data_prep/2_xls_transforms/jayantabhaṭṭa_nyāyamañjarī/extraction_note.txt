Structural Summary

In this file, the desired natural-language text, Jayantabhaṭṭa's Nyāyamañjarī (NM), is found by selectively extracting the NM <quote> elements from the surrounding Nyāyasaurabhaṭippaṇī (NSṬ) commentary that makes up the <body> element. This encoding reflects that the NSṬ was printed below the NM on the pages of Varadacharya's 1969-1983 Mysore edition; the NSṬ does not quote the NM in full. The NSṬ only extends for the first 3 out of 12 āhnikas. Nevertheless, for āhnikas 4–12, the same <quote> within <div> structure holds. Thus, the basic NM text is reconstituted by reconstructing the two-level <div> structure within the main <body> element with only the NM <quote> elements inside.

The two-level <div> structure is: 1) physical volume, 2) logical āhnika. Vol. I contains āhnikas 1–4, vol. II contains āhnikas 5–12.

Within the āhnikas, there are two kinds of further structural markup. Again, one is physical, the other logical. The logical markup is division into prose paragraphs with <p> elements. This generates the basic document candidates used for modeling.

The physical markup is the printed edition page number, which is the basis for creating identifiers. An attempt was made to salvage this information from the @n attributes of <pb> elements, which are located consistently just outside of, and specifically prior to, the desired NM <quote> elements (at least near the beginning of the file), by relocating them to be novel @pb-n attributes of NM <quote> elements, as reflected in the "modified" file ultimately used for transformation. However, this solution was not entirely successful, since the majority of <pb> elements begin to be located within <quote> elements after the NSṬ ceases at the end of āhnika 3 (the few exceptions: II.3, II.143, II.263, II.360, II.430, II.522, II.584, II.645). There are thus many <pb> elements per NM <quote> element rather than just one, as before. The resulting identifiers are therefore currently not yet very useful for humans and should be redone with different handling of the variously-located <pb> elements.

Currently, document identifiers are built from the volume number, āhnika number, preceding page number (determined in the above-mentioned way), and the number of the paragraph starting from the last time the page number changed.

Document grouping labels were produced from topic headers marked the by <head> element.
