Structural Notes: 

This text of Madhva's Anuvyākhyāna consists of a verse commentary on a prose base-text, Bādarāyaṇa's Brahmasūtra, which is structured as four adhyāyas with four pādas each, each of which contains differing numbers of sūtras. Madhva's verses generally correspond closely to the sūtras, with two verse-halves per sūtra, but there are numerous exceptions, e.g., over 200 commentarial verses with three half-lines.

Document candidates were generated for each verse, with identifiers from the straightforward adhyāya.pāda.sūtra numbering.

Document grouping was performed according to pādas.
