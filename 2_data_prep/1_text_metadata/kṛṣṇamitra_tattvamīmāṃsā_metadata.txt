Structural Notes: 

Document candidates were generated from paragraph markings found in printed book (sometimes those in source file needed to be manually brought in line), which were in turn numbered automatically; in a second round, it would be beneficial to re-do identifiers with page and line numbers, not yet provided in the source file. No document grouping was performed.


Other Important Notes: 

1) Following the edition, I have attributed this text to Kṛṣṇamitra.
