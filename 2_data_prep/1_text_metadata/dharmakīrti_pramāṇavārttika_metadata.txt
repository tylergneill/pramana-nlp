File Source: GRETIL


Edition: Y. Miyasaka 1971/72, Narita


Extent: 3 out of 4 paricchedas (see note below)


Input by: Motoi Ono


Structural Notes: 

This file contains the verse-only paricchedas, for which Dharmakīrti did not provide prose commentary. For the svārthānumāna pariccheda verses and their accompanying autocommentary, see the separate Svavṛtti file.

The pariccheda numbering here (despite Miyasaka, as overridden by Ono) is: 2) pramāṇasiddhi, 3) pratyakṣa, 4) parārthānumāna. The verse numbering for the pramāṇasiddhi pariccheda reflects the exclusion of the disputed pair of introductory verses. Thus, in Ono's file: "02001 pramāṇam avisaṃvādi jñānam arthakriyā-sthitiḥ".

Document candidates were generated from labeled half-lines. For this reason, automatic resizing of documents by way of document grouping labels was very important in this case.

Document grouping was carried out by laboriously digitizing the headers of Miyasaka's analytic table of contents and manually placing these in the corresponding place in the cleaned file. Only lowest-level headers (72) were used; higher-level headers were kept as removable notes.


Other Important Notes: 

1) Ono's partial sandhi analysis was automatically undone prior to further modeling preprocessing.

2) See Ono's "Explanatory Remarks" for further remarks on the original encoding.
