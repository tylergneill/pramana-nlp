The above numbering of sections and subsections is artificial. An error was made in applying this enumeration to the actual, cleaned text: what here appear as 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7 ended up one number too high in the cleaned file ("5.5", "5.6", "5.7", "5.8", respectively). This numbering should be fixed for the next round. (By contrast, the real section 5.8, i.e., the arthāpattipariccheda, is entirely missing from the source file.)

Document candidates were generated for each half-line, with identifiers based on the numbering explained above, plus the verse number within the section, plus "ab", "cd", or "ef" based on the pāda.

Document grouping was based on labeled sections and subsections. Since document candidates were very small in this case, the recombination into larger documents based on these grouping boundaries was very important.
