Other Important Notes:

1) "NOTES" sections removed.

2) [...] corrections (?); (...) additions/interpretations (?); functions not entirely clear but most likely relate to readings of Āloka of Durveka Miśra (?). Material silently kept. Spacing inconsistent.

3) [...] intertextual references (e.g., "[NMu 7]") removed. Better would have been to change to (...).
