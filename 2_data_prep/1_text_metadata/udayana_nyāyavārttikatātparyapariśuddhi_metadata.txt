Edition: not yet determined, but partial nature suggests A. Thakur 1967, Darbhanga


Extent: very partial, only adhyāya 1 out of 5

Structural Notes: 

This subcommentary largely follows the structure of the underlying Nyāyaśāstra, all the way down to sūtras, which are quote by pratīkas if at all.

Document candidates were generated from paragraph markings found in the source file. These seem mostly coherent but also inappropriately divide some verse half-lines from each other. This should be revised in a second round. Identifiers were generated automatically from adhyāya.āhnika.sūtra numbering — which was used for document grouping — plus a count of paragraphs since the last such change.
