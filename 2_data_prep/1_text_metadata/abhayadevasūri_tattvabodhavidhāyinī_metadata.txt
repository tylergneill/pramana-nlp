Document grouping based on 8 section headers found, numbered artificially.
	1 īśvarasvarūpavāda
	2 pūrvapakṣaḥ paraloke pratyavasthānam
	3 uttarapakṣaḥ — paralokasya vyavasthāpanam
	4 pūrvapakṣaḥ — jagataḥ īśvarakṛtatvasthāpanam
	5 uttarapakṣaḥ — jagataḥ īśvarakṛtatvanirākaraṇam
	6 prasaṅgavaśāt samavāyinirasanam
	7 prasaṅgikaṃ sattāpadārthanirasanam
	8 prāsaṅgikaṃ saṃyogasya nirasanam

Document identifiers created from above artificial section number, plus number of paragraph within that section. Much more useful would have been to use page numbers, which indeed recorded; do this for next round.
