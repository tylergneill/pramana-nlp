Input by: Piotr Balcerowicz


Structural Notes: 

This text actually consists of Siddharṣi Gaṇi' Vivṛti which quotes Siddhasena Mahāmati's short Nyāyāvatāra in full. A second round should more clearly distinguish the authorship in this way.

Document candidates were found already prepared in the source file, along with useful identifiers, as were groups thereof. This was accepted as-is.
