Structural Notes: 

This short text, as an independent primer on Buddhist logic, has three paricchedas: pratyakṣa, svārthānumāna, and parārthānumāna.

Tucci's paragraphs within paricchedas were numbered, and these, along with the pariccheda number (1–3) provided document candidates and their identifiers.

Document grouping was done at the level of paricchedas only.


Other Important Notes:
