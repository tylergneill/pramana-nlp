# Note

For some texts, the best or only available version source files were in private collections so far not shared publically online. The bulk of my own such files are from Eli Franco and (I believe) indirectly from Somdev Vasudev. Since these files often do not contain metadata concerning e.g. provenance information, the their creators' intentions are often unknown, and in my experience, this makes some scholars nervous about sharing them widely. I believe this is because, on rare occasions, the files contain explicit instructions from the creators *not* to share, based on whatever reason. But this is by no means always the case.

Here, however, in the interest of creating more openness, I am attempting to post all files for which I can verify that it is appropriate to do so. My verification process is as follows:

1. If essentially the same data is already publically available online (e.g., the same base file but in a slightly more faulty form), then I consider it ok to post the (e.g. better-quality) private version.
2. If it is not already online, then I adopt precaution and at first do not post. However, I do attempt to contact whomever I believe to be repsonsible for the creation of the file, and I ask whether I may post it.
3. If it is completely impossible to contact the creator, for example because of their having passed away, and if it is relatively clear through other means that they would not have had a strong objection, then I post. (This describes, for example, my understanding of the case of Helmut Krasser, based on personal communication with his former colleague Birgit Kellner.)
4. Also, if I am able to contact the creator and they respond with no objection, then I post.
5. Also, if the suspected creator does not respond to my inquiry after a reasonable period of time, then I post.
6. If at any time I hear from the creator that they have explicit objections, then I do not post or (as the case may be) I take down what was previously posted.

Here below, I give various details on the status of individual such files. All files should also be assumed to have been modified by myself (TGN) to some degree in preparation for the modeling experiements here, the details of which can be sought in the individual metadata files.
